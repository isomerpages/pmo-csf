#### **Conversations for the Future (Series)**

**Volume 1: Singapore’s Experiences with Strategic Planning (1988-2011)**    
The CSF team shares some of the key lessons that Singapore has gleaned in the course of conducting experiments about the future, communicating insights to decision-makers, and continually learning from a wide network of friends.

**Volume 2: Singapore’s Foresight Journey since 2011**    
In this volume, we have chronicled how our place in government has shifted and how the practice of foresight has evolved in the past six years since Vol. 1. This includes evolution in the methods we have employed, the networks we have built and the underlying philosophies that guide us.

**Volume 3: The Evolving Foresight Ecosystem in Singapore**
