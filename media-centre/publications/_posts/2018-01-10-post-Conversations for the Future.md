#### **Conversations for the Future (Series)**

**Volume 1: Singapore’s Experiences with Strategic Planning (1988-2011)**    
The CSF team shares some of the key lessons that Singapore has gleaned in the course of conducting experiments about the future, communicating insights to decision-makers, and continually learning from a wide network of friends.

**Volume 2: Singapore’s Foresight Journey since 2011**    
In this volume, we have chronicled how our place in government has shifted and how the practice of foresight has evolved in the past six years since Vol. 1. This includes evolution in the methods we have employed, the networks we have built and the underlying philosophies that guide us.

**Volume 3: The Evolving Foresight Ecosystem in Singapore**  
The team reflects on how the CSF and the foresight ecosystem have co-evolved in response to evolutionary pressures and a changing Public Service landscape. This volume also includes stories from other teams on the lessons they have learned in practicing foresight within the Public Service.
