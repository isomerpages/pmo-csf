#### **COVID-19 Shifts Infographic**


The World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern on 30 Jan 2020. At the time, few could have imagined the immense toll of the disease. Even fewer could have imagined that it would up-end our ways of life so comprehensively or raise the spectre of a global depression. However, the driving forces reshaping our lives did not all emerge overnight â€” COVID-19 has accelerated many pre-existing trends. It has also introduced new ones. Some of these have resulted in shifts that may usher in great transformation. In this infographic, CSF outlines some of the ways in which COVID-19 is reshaping the world in the form of five major shifts in the environment.
