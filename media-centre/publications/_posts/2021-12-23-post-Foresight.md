#### **Foresight (Series)**

_Foresight_ is the Centre for Strategic Futures' biennial publication covering research into international megatrends and emerging issues. It focuses on the _future_ of these developments -- how these trends and issues may develop, and their implications. It also contains CSFâ€™s reflections and experiences in foresight methods and major highlights from our work.
