<p><strong>What is this publication about?</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Thinking About Tomorrow </em>articulates&nbsp;the CSF’s updated understanding
of foresight—what we find true in theory and useful in practice. Here,
we share what we have learned, from both our own experience and others’.
<br>
<br><strong>What is in this publication?</strong>
<br>This publication has three sections:</p>
<p>1. Foundations—explaining what foresight is, the value it brings, and
the dispositions that its work requires.</p>
<p>2. Forms—describing different kinds of foresight projects and offers examples.</p>
<p>3. Footholds—providing heuristics and ideas for putting foresight to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who is this publication for?</strong>
</p>
<p>This publication is written mainly for public sector foresight practitioners,
which is who we are.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But if you find anything written so far interesting, then this handbook
is for you, too. We wrote it to be readable by avoiding jargon and writing
plainly.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>How should one treat this publication?</strong>
<br>You can read it linearly or modularly. To encourage you to meander through
the handbook, we made wayfinding easy and left breadcrumbs along the way.</p>
<p>
<br>There is no single right way to do foresight. Throughout, we invite you
to treat what you read as a starting point. Whether you are new to foresight
or have practised it for a long time, we hope this handbook will be a useful
and enjoyable companion on your journey into the future we are all heading
into.</p>
