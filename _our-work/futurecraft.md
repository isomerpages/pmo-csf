<h4><strong>FutureCraft</strong></h4>
<p>One of the key roles of CSF is to build strategic foresight capability
across the Government. The Centre thus conducts a series of workshops dubbed
“FutureCraft”, which aims to introduce key skills and tools relevant to
government foresight work, at the Civil Service College. Our FutureCraft
courses, which are for Singapore public officers only, are as follows:</p>
<h4><strong>FutureCraft 101: Introduction to Foresight</strong></h4>
<p>This introductory course provides a “taster” of foresight work in Government,
focusing on identifying signs of change, sense-making and communicating
insights. Budding futurists will be exposed to a range of basic tools to
get started in their futures journey.</p>

<h4><strong>FutureCraft 102: Building Your Toolkit</strong></h4>

biases in how public policy issues may be examined. Participants will also
come up with a range of possible futures which can be used to generate
conversations on emerging issues and inspire change.</p>
