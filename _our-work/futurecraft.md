#### **FutureCraft**

One of the key roles of CSF is to build strategic foresight capability across the Government. The Centre thus conducts a series of workshops dubbed “FutureCraft”, which aims to introduce key skills and tools relevant to government foresight work, at the Civil Service College. Our FutureCraft courses, which are for Singapore public officers only, are as follows:

#### **FutureCraft 101: Introduction to Foresight**

This introductory course provides a “taster” of foresight work in Government, focusing on identifying signs of change, sense-making and communicating insights. Budding futurists will be exposed to a range of basic tools to get started in their futures journey.

#### **FutureCraft 102: Examining Emerging Issues**
