### **Overview**

At the Centre for Strategic Futures (CSF), we believe in actively seeking out diverse and fresh perspectives to guide policy-making in the Singapore government and better prepare ourselves for the future. These perspectives can be in terms of process – new foresight and risk methodologies – or content. We interact and exchange views with a wide range of people to help us uncover biases and blind spots for Singapore, and generate new insights about our operating environment.

CSF meets over 200 thought leaders yearly through incoming visits, overseas trips, paid consultancies, interviews and curated events. We also meet regularly with futurists from various parts of the Singapore government to share best practices and build up the practice of foresight within government.

### **Programmes**

#### **Senior Researchers**

Initiated in 2015, the Senior Researchers Programme (previously known as "CSF Fellows Programme") engages PhD students from local universities for specific research projects. Examples of work previously undertaken by Senior Researchers include the implementation and analysis of ethnographic interviews to augment strategic planning.

In addition to tapping on local research expertise, the Senior Researchers Programme aims to provide 
opportunities to network with local academic institutions and lay a foundation for wider collaborations grounded in mutual research interests.
